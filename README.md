# Blossom Essentials Typescript

In October 2024, I made Simple Essentials.

While it was an okay addon, it was very horribly coded with no organization.

Then, a month or two later, I made Blossom Essentials.

Blossom Essentials is a great addon, but has flaws with features made before V0.1.5 like inconsistent uis and stuff.

This addon will aim to fix like all of that

Also its made in typescript because why not
